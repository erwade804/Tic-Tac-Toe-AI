Tic-Tac-Toe ML code

This is my first experience with Machine Learning and Python's PyGame. 

Feedback is accepted.

How it works:
      The chance of a move is given as 1/possible moves. With each iteration of a game, the agent then takes the board states and changes the amount of times the moves can be selected.
